          <h2>Describe the department or functional area and its methods of operation.</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="content">
          <p>During my internship, I was assigned to the Quality Assurance (QA) and Web Development departments. The QA department focuses on ensuring the quality and functionality of various software projects by identifying bugs, writing detailed tickets, and testing functionalities across multiple platforms like Blocksure, Greenlife, Microcredentials, ChangeGPS, and XFunge.</p>
          <p>The Web Development (Creatives) department handles website creation, modification, and optimization, primarily using WordPress. It involves both design and functionality, from cloning websites to making them fully responsive and deploying features like dropdowns, carousels, and custom posts.
            Their method of operation revolves around daily stand-up meetings, walkthroughs, documentation of tasks, test case creation, bug tracking, and continuous collaboration through task delegation and regular updates.

            The most memorable event during my practicum was working on the WordPress projects, especially when I was assigned to clone and redesign the Technopark and Alogis websites. It was a fulfilling experience to see the progress from a blank page to a fully functional and responsive site. One highlight was when I successfully implemented the mobile responsiveness and interactive features like dropdowns and tabs. It was both challenging and rewarding, and it gave me a great sense of accomplishment seeing my work live and functional.
